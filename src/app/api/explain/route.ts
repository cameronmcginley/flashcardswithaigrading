    ### Question
    ${front}
    
    ### Instructions:
    Provide a comprehensive explanation that:
    1. **Directly answers the question**
    2. **Gives relevant background context** to reinforce understanding
    3. **Includes clear, concrete examples**
    4. **Explains practical applications or implications** (real-world use cases, why it matters)
    5. **Uses precise, accessible language** (avoid fluff, no jargon unless explained)
    6. **Uses full markdown formatting**, including:
       - Headings
       - Bullet points
       - Code blocks (if relevant)
       - Diagrams (if relevant)
       - Math via LaTeX (surround with \`$...$\` or use \`$$...$$\` for blocks)
       - Anything else that is relevant or may be helpful to the user
    7. **Include details on real world applicability** including whether you think this is important or not
    8. **Include links to more information** if you think it is relevant
    9. **Be sure to mention technical specifics and terms** if they are relevant
    
    ### Additional Notes:
    - Use LaTeX for **mathematical notation** or formulas when needed.
    - Structure the explanation clearly with sections if the topic has multiple components.
    - Keep the response **focused but thorough**, roughly **200â€“400 words**.
    
    Respond in a way that is **educational and engaging**, as if you're walking a student through the concept 1-on-1.
